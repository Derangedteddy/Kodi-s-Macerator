# Kodi's Macerator

## v0.0.1 Alpha (Released 2/6/2026)



### Summary

Kodi's Macerator is a mod for Hytale that adds a machine to the game that assists with the processing of ores.  The machine pulverizes raw ore into ore dust, separating it from non-ore minerals and offering a higher yield than simply smelting the raw ore.  A single unit of ore produces two units of ore dust, which can then be smelted in a vanilla furnace to produce ingots.  The machine consumes fuel at the normal rate a furnace would.  Higher value ores take longer to macerate than lower value ores due to their durability.
